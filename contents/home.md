#### News

- 02/2025, A preprint is coming soon...


#### Biography

I'm a junior student majoring in Mathematics from University of Wisconsin Madison, I also minor in Computer Science and have a solid basic understanding of Electronic Engineering. In the fall of 2024, I joined the [Responsible AI (RAI) Lab](https://yushundong.github.io//students/), where I received invaluable mentorship from [Prof. Yushun Dong](https://yushundong.github.io/). I am deeply grateful to him for guiding me through my first steps into the world of research.

#### Research Interests

My current passion revolves around applications of more advanced mathematics in AI/ML, this includes:

1. <strong><strong>Graph Neural Networks && Trustworthy AI/ML</strong></strong> 
    * Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) in the context of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS)
    * Certification for AI/ML
2. <strong><strong>Hyperbolic Neural Networks</strong></strong> 
    * More applications implemented by HNNs, you may find something interesting in this [website](https://github.com/marlin-codes/Awesome-Hyperbolic-Representation-and-Deep-Learning?tab=readme-ov-file#graph-embeddings)
3. <strong><strong>Large Scale Optimization for ML</strong></strong>
4. <strong><strong>Information Geometry</strong></strong>

#### Misc

* In my leisure time, I play League of Legends. I once reached to D1 in CN and D2 in NA.
* I'm writing a [note](/static/assets/Notes.pdf) for the differential geometry from Ruobing Zhang's lectures.
