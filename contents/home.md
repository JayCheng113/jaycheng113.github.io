#### Biography

I'm a senior majoring in Mathematics for Programming and Computing at the University of Wisconsin Madison, with a strong foundational understanding of Electronic Engineering. In Fall 2024, I joined the [Responsible AI (RAI) Lab](https://yushundong.github.io//students/), where I have the privilege of being mentored by [Prof. Yushun Dong](https://yushundong.github.io/). I am deeply grateful to him for guiding me through my first steps into the world of research.

#### Research Interests

My passion lies in geometric deep learning, trustworthy AI, and scientific AI. My research interests include:

- <strong><strong>Trustworthy AI</strong></strong> 
    * ML certification and robustness verification.
- <strong><strong>Hyperbolic Neural Networks</strong></strong> 
    * Exploring novel applications of HNNs.
    * Related resources: [Awesome Hyperbolic Representation and Deep Learning](https://github.com/marlin-codes/Awesome-Hyperbolic-Representation-and-Deep-Learning?tab=readme-ov-file#graph-embeddings).
- <strong><strong>Scientific AI</strong></strong> 
    - AI methods for weather prediction
    - Reasoning capability of foundation agents in physical domains.



#### Misc

* I'm compiling a [note](/static/assets/Notes.pdf) on differential geometry (Riemannian Geometry in $\mathbb{R}^n$), based on MATH561 lectures by Ruobing Zhang.
