#### News

- 02/2025: A preprint is coming soon...


#### Biography

I'm a junior majoring in Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin Madison, with a minor in Computer Science and a strong foundational understanding of Electronic Engineering. In Fall 2024, I joined the [Responsible AI (RAI) Lab](https://yushundong.github.io//students/), where I have the privilege of being mentored by [Prof. Yushun Dong](https://yushundong.github.io/). I am deeply grateful to him for guiding me through my first steps into the world of research.

#### Research Interests

My passion lies in geometric deep learning, particularly in applying advanced mathematical geometry methods to empower AI. My research interests include:

- <strong><strong>Graph Neural Networks & Trustworthy AI</strong></strong> 
    * Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) in the context of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS).
    * ML certification and robustness verification.
- <strong><strong>Hyperbolic Neural Networks</strong></strong> 
    * Exploring novel applications of HNNs.
    * Related resources: [Awesome Hyperbolic Representation and Deep Learning](https://github.com/marlin-codes/Awesome-Hyperbolic-Representation-and-Deep-Learning?tab=readme-ov-file#graph-embeddings).
- <strong><strong>Generative Models</strong></strong>
    - I am currently exploring some interesting ideas in this field.

- <strong><strong>Information Geometry</strong></strong>
    - I am a newcomer to this topic and actively learning.


#### Misc

* I'm compiling a [note](/static/assets/Notes.pdf) on differential geometry, based on MATH561 lectures by Ruobing Zhang.
